MY WEEK 2 : JAVASCRIPT ASSIGNMENT

DECLARATION 
Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword: var carName; After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of undefined).
Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).
Example:
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

INITIALIZING
Initialization is the means of assigning an initial value to a variable. So undefined is the initial value of a declared variable.  
Example:
Var a = 12
Undefined.


DEFINITION
This is the process by which a variable is assigned a value.
Example:
Var a = 12
a = 12
